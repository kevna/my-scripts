My command line scripts for linux.
They attempt to conform to the UNIX principle - 'do ONE thing and do it well' and they output their warning and fatal eroor messages through STDERR

"addwatermark" places watermarks on to images, it takes a space delimited list of one or more files along with a list of zero or more switches (also space delimited) from:
	-h/?	display help message and exit
	-r	replace file instead of generating new file
	-f bar	specify "bar" as file to use as watermark
	-o #	specify # as percentage opacity of the watermark image
	-d bar	specify "bar" as the destination for the watermarked files
	-v/vv	use verbose (display progress) or very-verbose (also display file info) output

"comptex" script compiles LaTeX document using pdflatex, it too takes a space delimited filename list and zero or more switches from:
	-h/?	display help and exit
	-n #	compiles the document # times (default = 3)

"remspace.sh" simply iterates through a folder modifying the filenames to meet the following rules:
no capitals, no superfluous symbols, dashes replace spaces.
